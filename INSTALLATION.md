# Installation

You will need tree things in order two transcribe audios

1) `ffmpeg` a simple yet powerful audio converter
2) `transcript` a small program to use Google speech to text API
3) `Google cloud credenctials` you'll need this for communicate with Google speech to text API

## ffmpeg

Unfortunately there is no ffmpeg installer for Windows.

Please refer to [this page](https://www.iwingeek.com/install-use-ffmpeg-on-windows-10) for installation

## transcript

Unfortunately there is no installer for Windows either, but the good thing is that the steps are identical to `ffmpeg` installation

First download the latest `release.tar.gz` file from [here](https://github.com/fabioelizandro/speech-to-text/releases)

Now you have to do the exact same process as you did for `ffmpeg`, which is:

1) Extract folder to your desktop
2) Rename the folder to `transcript`
3) Move folder to `C://transcript`
4) Add `C://transcript/bin` folder the environment variables like you did for `C://ffmpeg/bin`
5) Lastly, open `C://transcript/bin` and rename `transcript32.exe` to `transcript.exe` if your system is 32 bits. Or, rename `transcript64.exe` to `transcript.exe` if 64 bits.

## Google cloud credentials

Now that you've got all installed, you'll need to provide the Google cloud credentials to `transcript`

Download you `credentials.json` to `C://transcript/` and exec the following cmd:

```shell
setx GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS "C://transcript/credentials.json"
```

All done! ðŸŽ‰
